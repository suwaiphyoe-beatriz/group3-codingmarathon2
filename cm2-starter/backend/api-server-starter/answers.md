```javascript
ret.id = ret._id;     // Create a new field "id" equal to "_id"
delete ret._id;       // Remove the original "_id" field
delete ret.__v;       // Remove the version key "__v" (used internally by Mongoose)
return ret;           // Return the modified object
```
The code customizes how Mongoose converts a document to JSON. It: Includes virtual fields (virtuals: true). Transforms the output by: Creating id from _id Removing _id and Mongooseâ€™s internal __v field Result: Clean, client-friendly JSON when sending documents in API responses.
